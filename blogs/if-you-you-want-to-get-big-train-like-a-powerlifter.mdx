So, we all know training for strength and training for size are two different
things, right? Well, that notion is not as correct as you might think.
Training for strength and for size are more similar than you might think.
Chances are if you are training for size, you are training for strength, too.
And a lot of the time if you are training for size, you are training for strength.

In this article, we are going to take a look at how training
like a powerlifter will help you get bigger and stronger.
And aid you in your fitness goals.

## 1-6 Reps for Strength, 8-12 Reps for Size?

As the title suggests, there is a notion that if you train at 1-6 reps, you will get stronger but not much bigger, and if you train at 8-12 reps, you will get bigger but not much stronger. However, this is not the case. If it were, what about 7 reps? Does it do nothing?

The truth is, you are building muscle at every rep range. The only thing that matters is whether you are training hard enough. If you are training close to failure, you will gain muscle. Sure, one rep is not as effective as five reps for building muscle, but it still contributes to growth. The optimal range is 5-30 reps.

However, I suggest you train at 4-6 reps, like powerlifters do. This rep range results in the least amount of muscle soreness, fatigue, and muscle damage. As a result, you can maximize your gains since your body does not have to work extra hard to recover while still receiving a similar amount of stimulus.

## High Frequency Training

Typically, powerlifters train their big three movements or variations of them 2-3 times a week. They do this for skill practice and strength adaptation. However, we can also train our muscles at least 2-3 times a week since our muscles are either growing or shrinking all the time. Muscles grow for up to 48 hours after a workout and then start to atrophy.

So, if we train our muscles every 48 hours, they will continuously grow. This is the most optimal way to train.

I recommend full-body workouts every other day or at least 2-3 times a week. If you find that boring, like many people do, I suggest an Upper/Lower split: Upper, Lower, Rest, Upper, Lower, Rest, Rest. This schedule provides adequate rest while maintaining enough frequency for optimal growth.

## Mechanical Tension and Progressive Overload

Many bodybuilders focus on the burn or the pump, which can be good indicators of workout intensity. However, these are not direct indicators of an effective workout.

Powerlifters, on the other hand, focus on mechanical tension and progressive overload. Mechanical tension refers to the amount of stress placed on muscles, while progressive overload involves gradually increasing weight or reps over time.

Mechanical tension is the primary driver of muscle growth, and progressive overload is a key indicator of improvement. If you prioritize these two principles, you will get bigger. Choose exercises that provide the most mechanical tension for your muscles and progressively increase the weight or reps. If you are growing, your numbers should steadily increase over time.

## Long Rest Times Between Sets

One major difference between bodybuilders and powerlifters is rest time between sets. Powerlifters take longer breaks to fully recover so they can exert maximum effort on each set. Bodybuilders should adopt this practice as well.

I suggest resting 3-5 minutes between sets for big compound exercises and 2-3 minutes for smaller isolation exercises.

## Fatigue and Muscle Soreness 

Powerlifters train in a way that minimizes fatigue and muscle soreness so they can recover effectively between sessions. As bodybuilders, we should do the same. Managing fatigue allows for more efficient training multiple times per week, leading to consistent progress.

If your goal is to get bigger, training like a powerlifter might be the best approach. Powerlifters focus on mechanical tension, progressive overload, and high-frequency training—all of which are key for muscle growth. By adopting their principles, you can maximize gains while minimizing unnecessary fatigue and soreness.

Instead of chasing the pump or short rest periods, prioritize strength progression, proper recovery, and strategic training volume. Whether you follow a full-body routine or an upper/lower split, training with intensity and consistency will help you build both strength and size.

So, if you want to grow, train smart—train like a powerlifter
