So, we all know training for strength and training for size are two different
things, right? Well, that notion is not as correct as you might think.
Training for strength and for size are more similar than you might think.
Chances are if you are training for size, you are training for strength, too.
And a lot of the time if you are training for size, you are training for strength.

In this article, we are going to take a look at how training
like a powerlifter will help you get bigger and stronger.
And aid you in your fitness goals.

## 1-6 Reps for Strength, 8-12 Reps for Size?
As the title suggests, there is a notion that if you train at 
1-6 reps you will get stronger but not that big, 
and if you train at 8-12 reps you will get bigger but not that strong.
However, this is not the case. If it was, you can literally see it omits 7 reps, 
what does that do then? Nothing?
